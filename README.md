2014 CfA Fellows Flashcards
===========================

An Anki flashcard deck of 2014 Code for America (CfA) fellows' headshots, names and city assignments [as listed on the CfA website](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2014-fellows/).

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net) is an open source spaced repetition flashcard system that I've been using since I read [these](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) [blog posts](http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk/articles/janki_method_refined). The desktop app, which has a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dae/anki), is free.
